Which version to choose?

The pack contains versions for Desktop and Mobile platforms in Linear and Gamma color spaces.

1) Check your color space settings under Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings.

2) Pick a version that matches your platform and color space.

For example, if you are developing a PC project and your color space is Linear, then
MUltistoryDungeonsPCLinear1.6.unitypackage is for you.

3) Go to Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package and select the one you want to import.

===================

Please make sure to backup your project before updating from any previous version, otherwise
you might loose some of your progress!

Note that every new level in mobile-gamma version is going to look a bit dark before the
lighting is baked.

Demo levels may have visual artifacts on Unity versions above 5.5. Usually, re-baking 
lightmaps solves the problem.

The pack is set up to work with the lightmap resolution of 5 and above, but it is possible
to set it to 3 and still get acceptable results especially on mobile platforms.
